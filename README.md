🌐 Language Detection using Machine Learning and NLP

    This project focuses on detecting the language of a given text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. 
    It leverages popular Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to preprocess data, train a classification model, and predict the language of text inputs.
